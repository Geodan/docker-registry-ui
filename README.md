# Docker Registry Web interface

## Synopsis

This Java application made with Spring Boot, Bootstrap and Handlebars creates a web interface for easy use of the
official Docker Registry. This application has a REST-interface which crawls for available images and tags on 
the filesystem and returns them as a JSON array, which is used in the web interface.

It is recommended that this application is used for internal use only as it has no authentication.

## Installation and quick start

1. Clone this repository 
2. Package it with Maven
3. Run this application!

For optimal use it is recommended that this application is used in combination with our Docker Image or Dockerfile.
